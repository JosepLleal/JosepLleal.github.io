# Josep Lleal
Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently on the fourth year of the video game design and development barchelor's degree at [CITM(UPC)](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). 
During these years I have used mainly C++ to develop games and my own game engine. I have also used Unity for some projects.

Gameplay programmer is my passion but I am opened to everything related to video games.

# Projects

## The Witcher: Ties of destiny

## Broken Engine
Broken Engine is a 3D game engine made by a team of 13 programmers using C++. This game engine was built to develop The Witcher: Ties of destiny.

My contributions to this engine:
- Animation System: Features skinning, interpolation between keyframes and blending between animations.
- Animator Tool: Developed the animator to streamline the importation of animations.
- Engine bug fixing: I also helped solving issues.

## Astral Engine
Astral Engine was created by [Victor Chen](https://github.com/Scarzard) and me for the Videogame engines subject for educational purposes.
The main goal was to code our own simple game engine with C++ from scratch using various external libraries, and for the last delivery, we implemented a high-level system, skeletal animation.

My contributions:
- Game Objects
- Decoupling Desing Pattern for Component creation.
- Engine overall aesthetic.
- Animation importing with Assimp.
- Hierarchy/Console/Resource window
- Every propietary file format.
- Scene serialization.
- Resource manager. Refactor for Components to use resources.
- Space partition as Quadtrees.
- Importing
- Animation component
- Bone parenting.
- Animation interpolation.
- Animation blending.

## RGBeam
This project is an AR (Augmented Reality) puzzle video game for android made with Unity. This game was created as the final project of the Augmented Reality subject.

## Burger Dreams
Artificial Intelligence Video game made by [Joan Barduena](https://github.com/JoanBarduena) and me with Unity using C# featuring autonomous agents. To make this game we used FSMs, Behaviour trees and our own steering behaviours. We also used Recast pathfinding with navmesh for the agents movement.

Here you can see how the game works: [Burger Dreams web](https://joanbarduena.github.io/Artificial-Intelligence/)

## Comand and Conquer: WarZone
A Command&Conquer themed video game which is a mix between a classic RTS game and a tower defense where two players battle each other on a 1vs1 locally.

You can see more information here: [Comand and Conquer: WarZone](https://stormhowlers.github.io/Command_and_Conquer_WarZone/)

My contributions to this project were:
- Design and code of the in-game UI
- Recreate the pause menu from the original game (Command&Conquer: Red Alert 2)
- Controller inputs
- Barracks selection to spawn troops
- Gold Production
