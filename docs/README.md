Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently on the fourth year of the video game design and development barchelor's degree at [CITM(UPC)](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). 
During these years I have used mainly C++ to develop games and my own game engine. I have also used Unity for some projects.
Gameplay programmer is my passion but I am opened to everything related to video games.
