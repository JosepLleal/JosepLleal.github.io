# Josep Lleal
Welcome to my portfolio! I am currently on the fourth year of the video game design and development barchelor's degree at [CITM(UPC)](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). 
During these years I have used mainly C++ to develop games and my own game engine. I have also used Unity for some projects.
Gameplay programmer is my passion but I am opened to everything related to video games.

# Projects

## The Witcher: Ties of destiny

## Broken Engine
Broken Engine is a 3D game engine made by a team of 13 programmers using C++. This game engine was built to develop The Witcher: Ties of destiny.
My contributions to this engine:
- Animation System: Features skinning, interpolation between keyframes and blending between animations.
- Animator Tool: Developed the animator to streamline the importation of animations.
- Engine bug fixing: I also helped solving issues.

## Astral Engine
Astral Engine was created by Victor Chen and me for the Videogame engines subject for educational purposes.
The main goal was to code our own simple game engine with C++ from scratch using various external libraries, and for the last delivery, we implemented a high-level system, skeletal animation.
My contributions:
- Game Objects
- Decoupling Desing Pattern for Component creation.
- Engine overall aesthetic.
- Animation importing with Assimp.
- Hierarchy/Console/Resource window
- Every propietary file format.
- Scene serialization.
- Resource manager. Refactor for Components to use resources.
- Space partition as Quadtrees.
